# FiresellTest-vuejs-

Hi, this is my first try using vue.js with Laravel framework. 

I am using this repo https://github.com/LaravelDaily/Laravel-API-Vue-Catalog as my reference
and modifying it accordingly based on my previous project, Fireselltest.

In this project, I only create a single page showing a Todo List using Vue.js and Restful Api .

You may check master branch for the codes.

Thanks :)
